/*
 * Unpacker for various Android packers/protectors
 *
 * Tim 'diff' Strazzere <strazz@gmail.com>
 *"
 * For education use only - find them malwares
 *
 *
 * Tested against malware packed with the following;
 *     - Bangcle (All versions)
 *     - APKProtect (native versions w/ crypto)
 *     - LIAPP (prereleased demo)
 *     - Qihoo Packer
 *
 *
 * This will dump the optimized dex (odex) file from
 * the system, meaning you will have to pull the
 * framework files to be able to deodex (in needed)
 * for the original dex file.
 *
 * For APKProtect, it should be combined with the
 * LD_PRELOAD hook'er to avoid the QEMU detection
 * if running on an emulator
